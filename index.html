  <h1><span style="text-indent: 0;">About Me</span></h1>

  <p><span style="text-indent: 0;">Information Security Researcher with over a decade long experience in multiple security domains: 
    <br>Security Governance-Data Security & Privacy
    <br>Communications & Network Security 
    <br>Software Security
    <br>Risk Management
    <br>Access Management
    <br>Security Operations
    <br>Vulnerability Assessment
    <br>Audit and Compliance
    <br>Security Architecture. 
    <br>Automating the 'Access Management' control at IBM led me to Data Science. 
    <br> 
    <br> At Georgia Tech, I have worked on National security, ML security, Malware analysis, Web security, AI safety projects. Currently designing a solution to mitigate threats in the shared socio-technical information environment under the supervision of Dr. Courtney Crooks at Georgia Tech.
     <br>
    <br>Also, a former small forward basketball player, reliable blue team player in CTFs, a good defender; and no, I did not choose a Cybersecurity career in 2011 because I enjoyed 
   breaking things! I enjoy strategizing and building processes,algorithms,applications, and teams. </span></p>
