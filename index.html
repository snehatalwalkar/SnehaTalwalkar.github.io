  <h1><font size="6">About Sneha Talwalkar Korde</font></h1>

  <p>A former small forward basketball player, reliable blue team player in CTFs, a good defender; and no, I did not choose Cybersecurity as my career since 2011 because I like to break things! I love strategizing and building processes/algorithms/applications/teams everything that lies at the intersection of humans and machines.</p>
