  <h1><span style="text-indent: 0;">About Me</span></h1>

  <p><span style="text-indent: 0;">Information Security Professional turned Researcher with over a decade long experience in multiple security domains: 
    <br>Security Governance-Data Security & Privacy
    <br>Communications & Network Security 
    <br>Software Security
    <br>Risk Management
    <br>Access Management
    <br>Security Operations
    <br>Vulnerability Assessment
    <br>Audit and Compliance
    <br>Security Architecture. 
    <br>Automating the 'Access Management' control at IBM led me to Data Science. 
    <br> 
    <br> Academic Pursuits:
    <br> Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Telecommunication at Maharshi Karve Stree Shikshan Samstha's Cummins College of Engineering. Undergraduate research: 'Fast Packet Classification Algorithms' advised by Dr. Mrudul Dixit.
    <br> Master of Science in Cybersecurity at Georgia Institute of Technology (incoming PhD student at University of Toronto, Faculty of Information).
    <br> At Georgia Tech, I have worked on national security, ML security, malware analysis, web security, AI safety, human machine learning projects. My capstone research project supervised by Dr. Courtney Crooks is mainly focused on the socio-technical adversarial environment.
     <br> 
    <br> 
    <br> Also, a former small forward basketball player, reliable blue team player in CTFs, a good defender; and no, I did not choose a Cybersecurity career in 2011 because I enjoyed 
   breaking things! I enjoy strategizing and building processes,algorithms,applications, and teams. </span></p>
