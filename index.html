  <h1><span style="text-indent: 0;">About Me</span></h1>

  <p><span style="text-indent: 0;">A former small forward basketball player, reliable blue team player in CTFs, a good defender; and no, I did not choose a Cybersecurity career in 2011 because I enjoyed breaking things! I love strategizing and building processes/algorithms/applications/teams everything that lies at the intersection of humans and machines.</span></p>
