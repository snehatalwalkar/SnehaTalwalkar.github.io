  <h1><span style="text-indent: 0;">About Me</span></h1>

  <p><span style="text-indent: 0;">
Information Security Researcher. I am passionate about solving information security and safety problems using interdisciplinary/cross-disciplinary novel approaches.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br> Academic Journey:
    <br> First year PhD student at the University of Toronto, Faculty of Information, advised by Professor Periklis Andritsos.
    <br> Master of Science in Cybersecurity at Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta. Supervisor- Dr. Courtney L. Crooks.
    <br> Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Telecommunication at Maharshi Karve Stree Shikshan Samstha's Cummins College of Engineering, Pune. Supervisor- Dr. Mrudul Dixit.
    <br>
    <br> Learning Journey Maps from Chris Ferguson has inspired me to map my own journey. So, here is a short version of my journey map: (It feels like deep diving in the world of security)
    <br> Inspired by Dr. Dixit's class on Computer Networks-> Network Security and more at my first job with Vodafone-> The CISSP Book by Shon Harris introduced me to the breadths of 'Security' in the industry-> Automating security controls at IBM led to data science-> Georgia Tech introduced me to a larger world of security research-> Exploring 'Methods' and building my research toolkit at UofT...
   
    <br> Also, a former small forward basketball player, reliable blue team player in CTFs, a good defender; and no, I did not choose a Cybersecurity career in 2011 because I enjoyed 
   breaking things! I enjoy strategizing, and building processes/algorithms/applications/teams. </span></p>
